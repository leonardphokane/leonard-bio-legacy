# 🧠 Case Notes — Responsible AI Inspector

Welcome to the digital diary of an AI ethics detective. These are short investigative write-ups where tech meets values — and bias meets justice.

## 🔍 Case 1: The Hiring Bot That Missed the Human Story

### 🎯 What’s Happening  
A corporate AI screens job applications with cold precision. It ranks resumes, flags top candidates, and rejects those with gaps in employment — often penalizing women who took time off for caregiving.

### ⚠️ What’s Problematic  
- **Bias baked into training data** — replicates historical hiring discrimination.
- **Zero transparency** — applicants don’t know why they were rejected.
- **No accountability** — the algorithm makes final decisions, no human review.

### ✅ One Responsible Fix  
Implement **fairness constraints** in model training to prevent biased patterns from dominating. Combine that with a **human-in-the-loop** system that reviews edge cases before rejection.

> Bonus Thought: Normalize career breaks in training data. Caregiving builds transferable skills — not red flags.

## 🧠 Case 2: The Proctoring AI with Tunnel Vision

### 🎯 What’s Happening  
An AI watches students via webcam during exams, analyzing eye movement and behaviors. But it often flags neurodivergent students or those in busy homes for “cheating,” based on nonstandard but innocent movements.

### ⚠️ What’s Problematic  
- **Discriminatory flags** against students with disabilities or different neurotypes.
- **Privacy invasion** in personal spaces like bedrooms.
- **No meaningful appeal** for students wrongly accused.

### ✅ One Responsible Fix  
Redesign the system so AI assists, not judges. Include:

- **Human review before any penalty**
- **Transparent criteria for alerts**
- **Accommodations for neurodivergent learners**

> Bonus Upgrade: Train the model on diverse behavioral patterns to avoid penalizing difference.

## ✍️ Final Reflection

Bias in algorithms isn’t accidental — it's historical data turned into modern decisions. Responsible AI requires rethinking assumptions, building inclusive systems, and centering human dignity.
